# SignIn Page Hydration Tests

This directory contains comprehensive tests for verifying that the signin page hydration issues have been resolved.

## Test Files

### `signin-hydration.test.tsx`
Core hydration tests that verify the signin page meets all requirements:

**Requirement 1.1: Page loads without removeChild errors**
- ✅ Renders signin page without DOM manipulation errors
- ✅ Handles multiple renders without DOM errors

**Requirement 1.2: Form elements hydrate properly**
- ✅ Renders all form elements correctly after hydration
- ✅ Handles form input changes without errors

**Requirement 1.3: No console errors during rendering**
- ✅ No React DOM operation errors during rendering

**Theme switching without DOM errors**
- ✅ Handles theme changes without causing DOM manipulation errors
- ✅ Handles system theme changes without errors

**Form submission functionality**
- ✅ Handles successful form submission correctly
- ✅ Handles form submission errors gracefully
- ✅ Shows loading state during form submission

**Hydration stability with providers**
- ✅ Maintains stable rendering with all providers

### `signin-e2e.test.tsx`
End-to-end tests that simulate real-world usage scenarios:

**Complete page rendering without hydration errors**
- ✅ Renders complete signin page with layout without DOM errors
- ✅ Handles rapid theme switching without DOM errors
- ✅ Handles system theme changes during form interaction

**Form submission with theme and locale providers**
- ✅ Handles complete login flow without DOM errors
- ✅ Handles authentication errors without DOM issues

**Stress testing for hydration stability**
- ✅ Handles multiple rapid re-renders without DOM errors
- ✅ Handles concurrent theme changes and form interactions

## Running the Tests

### Run all signin tests
```bash
npm run test:signin
```

### Run individual test files
```bash
# Core hydration tests
npm test -- signin-hydration.test.tsx

# End-to-end tests
npm test -- signin-e2e.test.tsx

# Both with verbose output
npm test -- --testPathPattern="signin.*test.tsx" --verbose
```

## Test Coverage

The tests cover all the critical areas that were causing the original hydration error:

1. **DOM Manipulation Safety**: Tests verify that no `removeChild`, `appendChild`, `insertBefore`, or `replaceChild` errors occur
2. **Hydration Consistency**: Ensures server-rendered HTML matches client-side rendering
3. **Provider Stability**: Tests that ThemeProvider, SessionProvider, and LocaleProvider work together without conflicts
4. **Theme System**: Verifies theme switching doesn't cause DOM errors
5. **Form Functionality**: Ensures the signin form works correctly after hydration fixes
6. **Error Handling**: Tests graceful error handling without DOM issues
7. **Stress Testing**: Rapid re-renders and concurrent operations to catch edge cases

## Error Detection

The tests use sophisticated error detection mechanisms:

- **Console Error Monitoring**: Spies on `console.error` and `console.warn` to catch DOM manipulation errors
- **React Error Boundaries**: Uses the `ProviderErrorBoundary` to catch provider-related errors
- **DOM State Verification**: Checks that DOM elements are properly rendered and functional
- **Hydration Mismatch Detection**: Filters out expected test warnings while catching real hydration issues

## Test Environment

The tests run in a realistic environment that simulates:

- **Next.js App Router**: Uses the actual signin page component
- **Provider Stack**: Full provider hierarchy including theme, session, and locale providers
- **Client-Only Components**: Tests the `ClientOnly` wrapper for hydration safety
- **localStorage**: Mocked localStorage with realistic behavior
- **matchMedia**: Mocked media queries for theme system testing
- **requestAnimationFrame**: Mocked for safe DOM manipulation testing

## Success Criteria

All tests must pass for the hydration fix to be considered successful:

- ✅ 18/18 tests passing
- ✅ No DOM manipulation errors detected
- ✅ No hydration warnings or errors
- ✅ Form functionality preserved
- ✅ Theme system working correctly
- ✅ Provider stability maintained

## Maintenance

When making changes to the signin page or related components:

1. Run the signin tests to ensure no regressions
2. Update tests if new functionality is added
3. Add new test cases for any new hydration-sensitive features
4. Ensure all error detection mechanisms are still working

The tests are designed to be comprehensive and catch hydration issues early in development.
