## Overview

The login page error is caused by React DOM hydration mismatches in Next.js 15.0.0. The "removeChild" error occurs when React tries to reconcile server-rendered HTML with client-side rendering, but finds DOM nodes that don't match its expectations. This is a common issue with Next.js 15 and React 18 when React Strict Mode is enabled and there are hydration inconsistencies.

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the codebase analysis, the issue stems from:

1. **Next.js 15.0.0 Compatibility**: Next.js 15.0.0 has known hydration issues with React 18.2.0
2. **React Strict Mode**: Enabled in `next.config.js`, causing double-rendering in development which can expose hydration issues
3. **ThemeProvider Hydration**: Despite attempts to fix hydration, the ThemeProvider may still cause server/client mismatches
4. **Suppressed Hydration Warnings**: Multiple `suppressHydrationWarning` attributes suggest existing hydration issues

## Architecture

### Current Architecture Issues
- React Strict Mode enabled globally
- ThemeProvider manipulates DOM classes during hydration
- Multiple providers wrapping the application
- Potential timing issues with localStorage access

### Proposed Architecture
- Implement proper hydration boundaries
- Add client-only rendering for problematic components
- Upgrade to stable Next.js version
- Implement proper loading states to prevent hydration mismatches

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Hydration-Safe ThemeProvider
```typescript
interface HydrationSafeThemeProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  defaultTheme?: Theme;
  storageKey?: string;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Delayed DOM manipulation until after hydration
- Proper loading states
- Safe localStorage access
- No server/client rendering differences

### 2. Client-Only Wrapper Component
```typescript
interface ClientOnlyProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  fallback?: ReactNode;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Renders nothing on server
- Shows fallback during hydration
- Prevents server/client mismatches

### 3. Updated Layout Component
```typescript
interface SafeLayoutProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  params: Promise<{ locale: string }>;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Minimal suppressHydrationWarning usage
- Proper provider ordering
- Safe theme initialization

## Data Models

### Theme State Management
```typescript
interface ThemeState {
  theme: Theme;
  resolvedTheme: 'light' | 'dark';
  isHydrated: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
}
```

### Hydration State
```typescript
interface HydrationState {
  isHydrated: boolean;
  hasMounted: boolean;
  isClient: boolean;
}
```

## Error Handling

### 1. Hydration Error Prevention
- Implement proper client-only rendering for theme-dependent components
- Add loading states to prevent flash of incorrect content
- Use consistent server/client rendering

### 2. Graceful Degradation
- Provide fallback themes when localStorage is unavailable
- Handle DOM manipulation errors gracefully
- Implement error boundaries for provider components

### 3. Development vs Production
- Different error handling strategies for development and production
- Proper logging for hydration issues
- Clear error messages for debugging

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Hydration Testing
- Test server-rendered HTML matches client hydration
- Verify no hydration warnings in console
- Test theme switching without DOM errors

### 2. Cross-Browser Testing
- Test login functionality across different browsers
- Verify theme persistence works correctly
- Test with different system theme preferences

### 3. Performance Testing
- Measure hydration performance impact
- Test loading states don't cause layout shifts
- Verify theme switching is smooth

### 4. Integration Testing
- Test complete login flow without errors
- Verify providers work together correctly
- Test locale switching with themes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes
- Temporarily disable React Strict Mode
- Add proper client-only rendering for ThemeProvider
- Implement hydration-safe DOM manipulation

### Phase 2: Structural Improvements
- Upgrade Next.js to stable version (15.1.x or 14.x LTS)
- Refactor ThemeProvider with proper hydration handling
- Add comprehensive error boundaries

### Phase 3: Long-term Stability
- Re-enable React Strict Mode with proper fixes
- Implement comprehensive hydration testing
- Add performance monitoring for hydration issues

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Next.js Version Strategy
**Decision**: Upgrade to Next.js 14.x LTS or latest stable 15.x
**Rationale**: Next.js 15.0.0 has known hydration issues that are fixed in later versions

### 2. React Strict Mode
**Decision**: Temporarily disable, then re-enable after fixes
**Rationale**: Strict Mode exposes hydration issues but is valuable for development

### 3. Theme Provider Architecture
**Decision**: Implement client-only theme provider with proper loading states
**Rationale**: Prevents server/client rendering mismatches while maintaining functionality

### 4. Hydration Strategy
**Decision**: Use explicit client-only boundaries for problematic components
**Rationale**: Provides clear separation between server and client rendering
