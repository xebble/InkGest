# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing a critical runtime error when accessing the login page: "NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a child of this node." This error is preventing users from logging into the system and appears to be related to React DOM hydration issues in the Next.js 15 application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the login page without encountering runtime errors, so that I can authenticate and use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the signin page THEN the page SHALL load without any "removeChild" runtime errors
2. WHEN the signin form is rendered THEN all form elements SHALL be properly hydrated without DOM manipulation errors
3. WHEN the page loads THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to React DOM operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have proper hydration handling, so that client-server rendering mismatches don't cause runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application renders on the server THEN the HTML SHALL match the client-side rendering exactly
2. WHEN React hydrates the application THEN there SHALL be no hydration warnings or errors in the console
3. WHEN providers are initialized THEN they SHALL handle client-only operations safely after hydration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme system to work correctly without causing DOM errors, so that the application appearance is consistent and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ThemeProvider initializes THEN it SHALL only manipulate the DOM after client-side hydration is complete
2. WHEN switching themes THEN there SHALL be no "removeChild" errors during DOM class manipulation
3. WHEN the system theme changes THEN the application SHALL respond without causing DOM errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Next.js and React versions to be compatible, so that the application runs without framework-level conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Next.js and React versions SHALL be compatible and stable
2. WHEN React Strict Mode is enabled THEN it SHALL not cause hydration-related DOM errors
3. WHEN the application builds THEN there SHALL be no version compatibility warnings
